The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog is unstirred. The fox tries again. And again.

And again.

Yet, the dog continues to snore gruffly, clear in deep slumber. 

As he exhales, the air whistled through his nose. This gave the clever fox an idea. The dog's next breath was met with a shrill sound. The dog jolted awake.

"What are you DOING?!" The dog exclaimed, clearly startled.

"I did nothing", the fox simply replied. "It was you."

The fox pointed at the dog's snout. Sure enough, at the end of his nose, fit snugly in his nostril, was a silver whistle.
